## 🚀 Quick Demo

### 1. **Backend is Already Running**
Your Node.js backend is running on port 4000 with mock AI enabled.

### 2. **Start the Frontend**
```bash
# If you need to install packages:
pip3 install streamlit requests

# Start the app:
python3 run_app.py
```

### 3. **Try the Demo**
1. **Open** http://localhost:8501 in your browser
2. **Enter repo URL**: `https://github.com/pallets/flask`
3. **Connect** to the repository
4. **Generate docs** (uses mock AI - takes ~30 seconds)
5. **Start chatting!** Try: "What does this repository do?"

## 🎭 **Mock Mode Demo**

The app currently uses mock AI responses, which means:
- ✅ No AWS credentials needed
- ✅ Fast setup and testing
- ✅ Realistic conversation experience
- ✅ Full UI functionality works

### Example Chat Flow:
```
You: "What does this repository do?"
AI: "This appears to be a web application framework... (mock response)"

You: "How is the code organized?"
AI: "The architecture follows a typical... (mock response)"
```

## 🤖 **Switching to Real AI**

When you're ready for real Claude AI:

1. **Add AWS credentials** to `backend/node-api/.env`:
   ```env
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   # Remove MOCK_AI_RESPONSES=true
   ```

2. **Restart backend**: The system will automatically use real Claude AI
